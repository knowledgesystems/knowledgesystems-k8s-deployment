  # To successfully set the cluster up, it will need to have at least 3 master nodes. 
  # The total number of nodes is calculated like: nodes = numOfMasterNodes + numOfMasterNodes * replicas. 
  # Hence, the defaults cluster.nodes = 6 and cluster.replicas = 1 means, 3 master and 3 replica nodes will be deployed by the chart.
