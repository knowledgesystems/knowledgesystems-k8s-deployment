# Apps
There are a lot of apps deployed across our AWS accounts, including cBioPortal, GenomeNexus, and OncoKB. The main documentation for these apps is up to the individual teams. In this repo, the documentation is related to certain infrastructure and deployment practices/requirements that each app has.
